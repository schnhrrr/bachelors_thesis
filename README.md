# Solving Differential Equations and Optimization Problems Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

This repository contains the code for my bachelor's thesis. The primary goal of the project is to find the trajectory of a spacecraft that is solely forced by gravitation and therefore needs no thrust. 
To get into the subject the differential equations of the (linerized) mathematical pendulum were also solved with the help of PINNs. Moreover the inverse problem of finding the pendulums thread length from given data was implemented.
